   "description":"The n-queens solver is a backtrack & branch-and-bound application that provides a solution to the n-queens problem. That is, it tries to find all the valid placements of n queens on a chessboard of size nxn. This corresponds to the positions for each of the n queens for each solution, where no queen can attack another. This takes into account all the valid movements a queen can make, i.e., move along a column, row, or diagonal, starting from her current position.
